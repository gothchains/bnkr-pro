With a free acount you are able to play up to an\n                hour of games like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and more. GeForce NOW connects to digital PC game stores such\n                as Steam, Epic Games Store, Origin, and more so you can stream the library of games you already own.\n                There is 1000+ games, ready to play. Here is the FAQ page. To get GeForce NOW, first download the\n                GeForce NOW .7z from this google drive which is also linked in the software list. Then extract it to a\n                file folder.

The correct application is\n                the one titled \"GeForceNOW\". Once you open it, log in, connect your Steam, Epic Games, and\n                Origin. To make an account go to the NVIDIA account creation/ log in. After that just load up the game\n                and wait for the queue)&lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_PdT3q3zeT5gBilUMdqR-BaYgpYfnNG3/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;Paint.net&lt;/a&gt;\n            &lt;/li&gt;\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/17WnPgHzNxNXazqP2aUlsUfv1fMJR3nW8/view?usp=sharing\"&gt;Opera\n                    GX&lt;/a&gt; IMPORTANT NOTE: THIS DOES NOT ALLOW YOU TO USE A VPN.
